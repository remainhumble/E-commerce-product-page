- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of responsive web design, particularly using CSS Grid and Flexbox together for complex layouts. I learned how to structure semantic HTML for accessibility and how to use CSS custom properties for easier theme management. Additionally, I improved my workflow by adopting a mobile-first approach.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on:

- Deepening my understanding of advanced CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts for more complex responsive designs.
- Improving accessibility by learning more about ARIA roles and best practices for inclusive web development.
- Refining my use of CSS custom properties for scalable and maintainable theming.
- Exploring component-based design systems to streamline development and ensure consistency across projects.
- Experimenting with modern CSS features like container queries and logical properties as browser support improves.

- [Build this image slider with JavaScript!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=749ta0nvj8s&t=703s) - This is an image slider program that you can create as a beginner. We will be using element selectors to create a nodelist of images to cycle through. An image to be displayed will have a class added to their classList that contains display: block. You will need at least a few images of your choosing to work with. I recommend image that are roughly the same size.
